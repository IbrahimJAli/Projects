# ♟️ Online Checkers Game

This is a collaborative online checkers game built by our class of 60 students as a collective programming project. It features real-time multiplayer gameplay, interactive UI, and a classic checkers ruleset — all developed through teamwork, version control, and a shared passion for learning. My team and I devolped the database for the game.
